     * </p>

     *   However there are cases where the preferred implementation differs.
     *   For example objects which represent a simple string themselves rather
     *   return their object state / string value directly.

     *
     * <p>
     *   Prefer to implement this method in every type instead of writing
     *   "too smart" super-types with helpers like get_class() etc. that
     *   apparently do the job with less code for more types.
